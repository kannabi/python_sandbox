            (Go ahead and bark after dark)
            Fallen star, I'm your one call away
            Motel halls, neon walls
            When night falls, I am your escape

            When you lay alone, I ache
            Something I wanted to feel


            If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love
            Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
            'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
            But an angel ain't what I need

            Not anyone, you're the one
            More than fun, you're the sanctuary
            'Cause what you want is what I want
            Sincerity

            Souls that dream alone lie awake
            I’ll give you somethin’ so real
            If you've been waitin’ for fallin' in love
            Babe, you don't have to wait on me
            'Cause I’ve been aimin' for Heaven above
            But an angel ain't what I need

            Pull me oh so close
            'Cause you never know
            Just how long our lives will be

            If you've been waitin' for fallin' in love
            Babe, you don't have to wait on me
            'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
            But an angel ain't what I need

            I fell for your magic, I tasted your skin
            And though this is tragic, at least I found the end
            I witnessed your madness, you shed light on my sins
            And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?

            I know you're not in love like you used to be
            Guess I’m not the one, like you used to think
            So you just run
            I know that I'm stuck in this misery
            Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
            So I’ll just run (Ooh)

            You bathe in your victory
            You blew out on my fuse
            And if I took on the planet
            Will I pay my dues?
            Your love was a mystery
            Yeah, my love is a fool
            And I travel the country just to get to you

            I know you're not in love like you used to be
            Guess I'm not the one, like you used to think
            So you just run
            I know that I'm stuck in this misery
            Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
            So I'll just run

            And I travel the country
            And I travel the country just to get to you
            I know you're not in love
            I know you're not in love
            I know you’re not in love
